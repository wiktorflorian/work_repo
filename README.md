# Work Projects Repository

Welcome to the Work Projects Repository! This repository contains my work projects, showcasing my expertise and contributions in various areas. Currently, it includes the **sheets_api** folder, which contains an IPython Notebook file (**project.ipynb**) demonstrating my work with the Google Sheets API.

## Sheets API Project Description

The **sheets_api** project focuses on utilizing the Google Sheets API to download data from a specified sheet (which is integrated with Google Forms) and save it as an Excel file ('.xlsx'). This functionality allows for efficient data extraciton and processing from Google Sheets, enabling streamlined workflows and enhanced data management.

### Contents
+ **sheets_api/**: This directory houses the project files related to the Google Sheets API integration.
  + **sheets_api.ipynb**: An IPython Notebook file that showcases the implementation and functionality of the project. It includes detailed explanations, code samples, and demonstrations of downloading data from a sheet and saving it as an Excel file. 

## CSV to Excel Conventer

**Currently in progress, ensuring smooth functionality*

**The CSV to Excel Conventer** project was conceived as a solution to address the challenges faced when working with .csv files containing incorrect Polish characters. It was observed that one of the contractors consistently sent .csv files with improperly saved Polish characters, which had to be manually corrected using Excel's find and replace function. Additionally, product names often posed problems due to the presence of commas or other characters.

The primary objective of this project is to automate the conversion of .csv files to .xlsx format while preserving the orginal data structure. By implementing this converter, the need for manual intervention to correct Polish characters and handle product name issues will be eliminated. Futhermore, the converter will ensure the seamless transfer of data from .csv files to .xlsx files, facilitating more efficient data management.

### Contents
+ **csv_to_excel**: This directory houses the project files related to saving .csv file to .xlsx with same structure.
  + **csv_to_excel.ipynb**: An IPython Notebook file that showcases the implementation and functionality of the project. It includes detailed explanations, code samokes, and demonstration of saving .csv to .xlsx. 

**The CSV to Excel Converter** project aims to streamline the data conversion process and improve data integrity by automating the correction of Polish characters and handling product name issues. By implementing this solution, users will experience a more efficient and accurate data transformation process, enabling them to focus on their core tasks with enanced productivity.
