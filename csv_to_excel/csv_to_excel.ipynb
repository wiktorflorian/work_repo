    "# CSV TO EXCEL CONVENTER\n",
    "\n",
    "**The CSV to Excel Conventer** project was conceived as a solution to address the challenges faced when working with .csv files containing incorrect Polish characters. It was observed that one of the contractors consistently sent .csv files with improperly saved Polish characters, which had to be manually corrected using Excel's find and replace function. Additionally, product names often posed problems due to the presence of commas or other characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to automate the conversion of .csv files to .xlsx format while preserving the orginal data structure. By implementing this converter, the need for manual intervention to correct Polish characters and handle product name issues will be eliminated. Futhermore, the converter will ensure the seamless transfer of data from .csv files to .xlsx files, facilitating more efficient data management.\n"
